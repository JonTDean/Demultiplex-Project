## Cell Biology

While not delving *too* much into Chemistry, the below will be a summarized example of cell biology and it's mechanisms. 

### Primary Nucleobases -

Starting from the 5 main Nucleobases for RNA/DNA, we can see that they are comprised of the following Amino Acids.

#### Pyrimidine Molecules (Fused Rings)

1. Thymine (Methylpyrimidine)
    * Complimentary: **DNA**/**RNA**(*Cytosine*)
    * Present in: **DNA**

2. Uracil (Pyrimidine)
    * Complimentary: **DNA**/**RNA**(*Cytosine*)
    * Present in: **RNA**

3. Cytosine (Aminopyrimidine)
    * Complimentary: **DNA**(*Thymine*) **RNA**(*Uracil*)
    * Present in: **DNA**/**RNA**

#### Purine Molecules(Single Ring)

1. Guanine (2-Aminohypoxanthine)
    * Complimentary: **DNA**/**RNA**(*Adenine*)
    * Present in: **DNA**/**RNA**

2. Adenine (6-Aminopurine)
    * Complimentary: **DNA**/**RNA**(*Guanine*)
    * Present in: **DNA**/**RNA**

#### Vocabulary

* DNA: Deoxy Ribonucleic Acid, instructions for the human body. Acting as the framework for all biological matter.

* RNA: Ribonucleic Acid, forming 2 different primary types that further branch out into specific functionality; mRNA, ncRNA.

* UTR: Untranslated Region of the Amino Acid sequence. 99% of the sequences found in nature are non coded nucleic chains, essentially useless fluff acting as a "filler".

* 3' & 5': These are endpoints for the translated region. Specifically the 3rd carbon atom (sugar group located here) and 5th Carbon(phosphate group located here). When polymerization of the Monomers occurs, 3' and 5' targets on the rings form esther bonds forming complex polymers (Proteins and their complex multiary structures).
